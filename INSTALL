This is a shellscript, the only installation procedure is to 

1. Make sure you have bourne shell in /bin/sh

2. Make fargo2hnb executable
   
   $ chmod 555 fargo2hnb

   Permission 555 is a good guess. It allows you any user to execute
   but you are unable to modify or delete it accidentally.

3. copy it into a directory in your PATH variable
   (such as /usr/local/bin or similar)

   $ cp fargo2hnb /usr/local/bin

4. Enjoy!
