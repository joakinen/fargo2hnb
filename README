fargo2hnb

fargo2hnb is a shellscript for importing OPML files generated using fargo.io 
into hnb (hierarchical notebook), a curses outliner for using in command line
terminals.

See http://hnb.sourceforge.net

Optionally fargo2hnb can create a HTML file combining the files downloaded.

For a list of options just execute it with no parameters.
