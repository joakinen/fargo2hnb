NAME
	fargo2hnb - Fargo to hnb importer

SYNOPSIS
	fargo2hnb [options] 

DESCRIPTION
	fargo2hnb is a shellscript for importing OPML files generated using 
	Fargo (an online outliner) into hnb (hierarchical notebook), a curses 
	outliner for using in command line terminals.

	fargo2hnb creates a new hnb database (or updates an existing one) that 
	will contain all of the outlines imported, each one under a different 
	branch in hnb, named after the file it came from. 
	
	Before using fargo2hnb you will need to generate in Fargo public links 
	for each file you may want to import into hnb and then create a text 
	file in the same computer you will execute fargo2hnb containing all of 
	the links, one link per line. 
	
	Optionally fargo2hnb can create a HTML file combining the files 
	downloaded with an indentation scheme corresponding to the outline.
	
	For downloading the files from your Dropbox repository you will only 
	need wget or curl installed on your computer.
	
	For a list of options just execute it with no parameters.
